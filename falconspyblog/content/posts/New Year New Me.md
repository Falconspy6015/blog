# A New Year, A New Vision

As the new year unfolds, I'm reflecting on the journey so far and looking ahead to the exciting challenges and opportunities to come.

## Academics and Aspirations
- My focus remains on excelling in electrical engineering at IITM, diving deeper into semiconductor specialization, and staying aligned with my goal of securing a top-tier placement at companies like NVIDIA, Intel, and Amazon.  
- Beyond academics, I aim to sharpen my competitive programming skills, mastering problem-solving to stand out in tech challenges.

## Building and Innovating
- I’ve made strides in personal projects, from developing apps like Florafix to diving into open-source and honing my web development skills with frameworks like Hugo.  
- CTF challenges and exploring cybersecurity continue to expand my skill set and fuel my curiosity for problem-solving.

## Health, Habits, and Growth
- Discipline in routines like morning study sessions and mindful eating remain key to balancing my ambitions with personal well-being.  
- Music, podcasts, and meaningful interactions are helping me stay relaxed and creative.

## The Road Ahead
2025 is about building momentum toward becoming financially stable and striving for excellence in all my endeavors, whether it's academics, projects, or personal growth. It's another step closer to the big dream of making an impact and supporting my family.

Let’s keep pushing boundaries, learning, and growing.

**Here’s to a transformative year ahead—Happy New Year!**
