Automation isn't just a buzzword. It’s quietly revolutionizing the way we live, work, and interact with the world. From the moment you wake up to the time you hit the bed at night, automation is there, making everything smoother and more efficient. But what does this really mean for us as individuals?

## **What is Automation?**
